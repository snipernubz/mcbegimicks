# What is this

This is a collection of gimicks for mcbe that uses websockets to remotely run commands 

## gimicks

These gimicks can do things like, give you a random item every ten seconds, place a random block beneath you every ten seconds and more.

### debug 
The two debug scripts "mcdebug.js" and "rmccli.js" .
"mcdebug.js" will listen for events and log them to console or a csv file (csv logging is a WIP), while "rmccli.js" allows you to remotely input vanilla commands.
